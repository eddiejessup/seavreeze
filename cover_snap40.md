I am writing to apply for the position of Machine Learning Scientist.

I currently work as a data scientist for Booking.com, in the front-end team.

Before this I was a software developer at a startup, building a web application for ad-hoc analysis of geospatial data. Before this I completed a PhD in computational biophysics in the Physics department of Edinburgh University.

I enjoy my current work, but I feel I can better use my skills in quantitative analysis and scientific thinking in a more data-oriented role, and would relish the chance to move to a city such as Amsterdam.

In these regards, this opportunity is one about which I'm very excited, and for which I feel I am extremely well qualified.

Through my PhD, as well as during my previous Masters degree in Theoretical Physics, I have developed the analytic skills necessary to deal with statistical and mathematical aspects of the work. My PhD involved writing and running Python programs to simulate large numbers of bacteria in confined spaces. It required extensive analysis of the resulting large data-sets, as well as of experimental data from collaborators. This was done using Numpy and Pandas, with clustering analysis carried out on the data using Scikit-learn.

As an example of such analysis, a significant part of my work involved accounting for subtle statistical biases introduced by imperfect microscope measurements of bacterial positions.

In my position as a software developer, I have deepened my familiarity with Pandas, through an independently driven project to allow interactive analysis of geo-spatial data by users of the product. Working on the back-end of a data-driven product also requires competency using S\smaller{QL}, and knowledge of best-practices in developing and maintaining a code-base.

I am extremely capable in a wider range of software contexts, which I have extended through personal projects; for example, I am currently working on a web application to analyse and visualise government budget data, using the Python web framework Django, and the visualisation library d3.js.

My PhD gave me many opportunities to develop my skills as a communicator of complex information, through talks at conferences and academic publications. The interdisciplinary nature of my work required me to tailor the presentation of my work to a diverse range of audiences with varying backgrounds. In my current role, I communicate my progress to the team in daily meetings, which again requires a consideration of the audience since the group comprises both software developers and geo-spatial analysts.

As a part of the Analytics team at Booking.com, I look forward to contributing an enthusiastic and rational attitude, in order to infer practical and robust conclusions from large, disparate sets of data.

I appreciate your consideration of my application, and look forward to hearing from you.


Hi,

I'd like to apply for the data scientist position with you. I'm really excited about the product and work you're doing, and I'd love the opportunity to help you grow.

I'm currently a data scientist working for Booking.com, in Amsterdam. I'm doing statistical analysis and machine learning using Hive and Spark, and the Python ecosystem of scientific libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas. I'm also involved in designing and evaluating A/B tests, and explaining their results to decision-makers. I've been working there just under a year, and I'm enjoying the work, but I'd really like to be able to do something more meaningful and helpful to people.

Previously I was a software developer for a startup in Edinburgh, where I helped to build a web application enabling analysis of geospatial data. I was mainly working on the Python backend, but as it was a small company I was also heavily involved in the front-end, and deployment on Amazon Web Services.

Before this I completed a PhD in biophysics, in the Physics department of Edinburgh University, where I was designing and running simulations of bacterial collective motion, and analysing experimental data of the same behaviour. The interdisciplinary nature of my work was valuable in teaching me how best to explain methods and results to audiences with diverse backgrounds.

As a part of snap40, I look forward to contributing an enthusiastic and rational attitude, with the technical skills to get meaningful signals from your data.

Please find attached my CV, and if you have any questions please let me know.

Thanks,
Elliot Marsden
