        \opening{Dear Andrew,}

        I'm currently finishing writing my thesis for a PhD in computational biophysics in the Physics department of Edinburgh University. Before then I graduated from Durham University, where I studied Theoretical Physics. My PhD has consisted mainly of writing and running code for numerical simulations of the movement of large numbers of bacteria in confining environments.

        I've enjoyed working in Physics over the last four years, but both in and out of work my attention has been more focused on its computational side, and on writing software in general. I feel like I've had a good experience of academia and am glad I did my PhD, but through it I've realised my ambitions lie elsewhere, so I'd like to move into a job better suited to those interests.

        Outside of my PhD, I've had personal experience with many areas of IT, such as maintaining servers, and developing web applications. I believe I'd be an enthusiastic and valuable contributor to your company, and I'd enjoy the opportunity to broaden and make more practical use of my skills.

        I expect to hand in my thesis at the end of April, and would be available to start any time after then.

        \closing{Regards,}

    \end{letter}
