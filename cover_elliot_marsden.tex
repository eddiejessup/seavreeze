        I'm currently finishing writing my thesis for a PhD in computational biophysics in the Physics department of Edinburgh University. Before then I graduated from Durham University, where I studied Theoretical Physics. My PhD has consisted mainly of anaysing the movement of large numbers of bacteria in confining environments, through numerical simulations, and analysis of experimental data.

        The simulations and analysis have been carried out mainly in Python, with numerically intensive parts written in C. Analysing the positions of thousands of bacteria over time involved filtering and interpreting large sets of incomplete and messy data. The productive combination of the distinct skill-sets of myself and my experimental collaborators was immensely satisfying.

        I've presented my work at several conferences, to audiences ranging from statistical physicists to molecular biologists, and have authored and contributed to papers, one of which was selected for the front cover of Physical Review Letters.

        I've had experience using bioinformatics software to analyse sequence data, using Amazon's cloud computing platform. In my spare time I've a great interest in software development, and have completed several personal projects, which have included building web applications from the ground up. I'm proficient using common software development tools such as version control, task automation and in Linux environments.

        My doctoral work has been done in a very interdisciplinary environment, and of its course my interests have shifted towards more biological areas; I would be delighted to have an opportunity to cotinue to use my interests in both science and software to make a real impact on the world.

        \closing{Regards,}
