        I'm currently finishing a PhD in computational biophysics in the Physics department of Edinburgh University. Before then I graduated from Durham University, where I studied Theoretical Physics. My PhD has consisted mainly of writing and running code for numerical simulations of the movement of large numbers of bacteria in confining environments.

        I've enjoyed working in Physics over the last four years, but both in and out of work my attention has been more focused on its computational side, and on writing software in general. I feel like I've had a good experience of academia, but I've realised my ambitions lie elsewhere, and I'd like to move into a job better suited to those interests.

        I've developed many projects from scratch, primarily in Python, and have developed several using Django and Flask. I'm comfortable with HTMl, CSS, Javascript, jQuery through web applications I've worked on. I don't have experience using PostgreSQL in particular, but I've used MySQL, SQLite and cloud databases, and am generally familiar with relational databases.

        Much of this work is available on my github page (@eddiejessup). The latest project I completed was a website presenting recycling collection information for Edinburgh, (although it's no longer working as the council stopped publishing the data!) The source can be found on github under `edrecycle', and the website at `edrecycle.elliotmarsden.com'.

        \closing{Regards,}
