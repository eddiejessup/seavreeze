        Dear Sir/Madam,

        I'm applying for the position of Bioinformatician, as I feel my work inside and out of my \smaller{PhD} has prepared me for this role. Through my background in physics I've gained the computational and mathematical skills needed to do the analysis and development required, and my experience in a multidisciplinary, biologically oriented research group has given me the necessary knowledge to understand the science behind it.

        My \smaller{PhD} has primarily involved writing Python code to simulate biological systems, and analysing its results, as well of those of collaborators' experiments. I've had the chance to work in a variety of teams through the multiple projects in which I've played a part, alongside my main line of research. I've had my work published in two papers, and have presented at several conferences.

        I'm very comfortable using Linux and its associated development tools, and have experience of writing code for computer clusters and working in such environments. My usual language of choice is Python, and I am also proficient in C and Java. Through work with collaborators I've had experience of analysing sequence data using bioinformatics software.

        I would love the opportunity to work in this area; to combine my passions for both science and computing to make a real impact. I'm also excited at the prospect of working in such an international, multidisciplinary context.

        \closing{Regards,}

    \end{letter}
