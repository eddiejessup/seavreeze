I'm currently finishing a PhD in computational biophysics in the Physics department of Edinburgh University. Before then I graduated from Durham University, where I studied Theoretical Physics. I feel I'm perfect for this role as I have exactly the desired skill-set, and I'm enthusiastic about sustainability.

My PhD has consisted mainly of writing and running software, written in Python with numerically intensive parts written in C, for numerical simulations of the movement of large numbers of bacteria in confining environments. My background in physics has given me the analytical skills needed to do robust statistical analysis, and the numerical simulation side of my work has given me experience in designing efficient and robust algorithms. The nature of doing a PhD naturally fosters the ability to generate and follow through on ideas independently, while also working with collaborators to share specialised skills and knowledge to move work forward. This is especially challenging when the nature of doing novel research makes the correct direction to take far from obvious.

Outside of my work, I've developed many projects from scratch, mainly in Python, and mainly as web applications using Django and Flask. I don't have experience using PostgreSQL, but I've used MySQL, SQLite and cloud databases, and am generally familiar with relational databases. I'm very comfortable working in a Linux environment and have done so in and out of work, administering the various machines I use at work and my own servers. You can see my work on Github, username 'eddiejessup'.

I'm passionate about environmental sustainability, and would really love an opportunity to make a useful difference in this area. I made a web application to scrape recycling collection dates and make them publicly searchable by street (at http://edrecycle.elliotmarsden.com, although the council recently made this no longer possible), I've been involved in work to reduce plastic recycling waste in Edinburgh, and am an active member of the Scottish Green party.
