        I'm applying for the role of Associate Bioinformatics Scientist, as I feel my work inside and out of my \smaller{PhD} has prepared me for this position. Through my background in computational physics I've gained the practical skills needed to do the analysis and development the job requires, and my experience in a multidisciplinary, biologically oriented research group has given me the necessary knowledge to understand the science behind it.

        My \smaller{PhD} has involved writing Python code to simulate biological systems, and analysing its results, as well of those of collaborators' experiments. Over the last few years my interest has shifted towards biology, due to its exciting opportunities it offers to use my passion for both computing and science to make a real impact on the world.

        I'm very comfortable in a Linux environment and its associated development tools, I use version control extensively, and have experience with issue tracking via Github. I've worked with databases in projects I've completed outside of academia, such as creating a web application to present recycling collection dates, searchable by street, which involved connecting Python code to an \smaller{SQL} database. Through work with collaborators I've had experience of analysing sequence data using bioinformatics software through Amazon \smaller{EC2}.

        \closing{Regards,}
